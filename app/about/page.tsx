          Thank you for your interest in facilitating the “Navigating the
          Digital Storm” presentation which focuses on online safety and scams
          targeting teenagers and young people in our communities.

          The drive behind this effort stems from the overwhelming response we
          received at recent conferences. Attendees approached us after every
          presentation, saying:{" "}
          <b>
            “This content is vital for parents and teens. How can we help spread
            the information you are sharing?”
          </b>{" "}
          This resource is our direct answer to those questions. Keep the
          questions coming!
